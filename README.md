### Project Overview

 The Olympic Games, considered to be the world's foremost sports competition has more than 200 nations participating across the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart.

Throughout this project, we will explore the Olympics dataset(scraped from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-time_Olympic_Games_medal_table) , look at some interesting statistics and then try to find out which country is the King of Olympic Games.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, you will have a better understanding of data handling with python(pandas). 
Things learned in this project:-

Dataframe operations

Conditional statement and loops

List operations

Bar Plotting

Mathematical operations


### Approach taken to solve the problem:-

 - Stacked overflow was a great help in dealing with the error.
-Documentation of matplotlib ,pandas ,and numpy gives us a vast variety of method and function with which we can do complex things in few lines of codes.




### Challenges faced:-

 While applying multiple method in a single line of code,the code used to gives lot of error,while executing.
-Knowing the output of each method and type of data which is coming out help us to achieve our objective in single line of code. .


### Additional pointers

 Things to do before touching any datasets:


First look at the data ,understand each feature .
Note down which column are categorical and which are numerical .
Check for null values and calculate its percentage.
Build your Own hypothesis and test it
